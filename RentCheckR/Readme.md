# RentCheckr

RentCheckr fixes the biggest problem in the rental market: information asymmetry. Renters are expected to make high-stakes decisions — accepting a new rent, challenging an increase, signing a lease, moving suburbs — without the market context and rights guidance that property professionals take for granted.

RentCheckr turns that fog into something you can act on: clear market signals, clear legal guardrails, and clear next steps.

Currently available for the **Sunshine Coast, Queensland**.

## What it does

**Check a Rent** — Enter an address, property basics, and the asking rent. Get a plain-English verdict (fair, high, or well above market) with confidence level and key drivers.

**Check a Rent Increase** — Enter your current rent, the proposed increase, and relevant dates. RentCheckr assesses reasonableness against market context and walks you through what's lawful, what's questionable, and what evidence you'd need.

**Find a Rental** — Describe your needs (budget, area, commute, pets, bedrooms) and get realistic options with clear trade-offs between suburbs, budgets, and property types.

**Know Your Rights** — Plain-language guidance on repairs, entry, bond, notice periods, and dispute pathways — without dumping legislation on you.

**Find a Room / Granny Flat** — A lightweight pathway for people who need something affordable fast.

**Ask Brian** — The in-app assistant that takes messy, real-world rental questions and turns them into structured answers and suggested actions.
